+ New Database system to handle player profile  cus the old one kinda shit
+ Converted all card to json file
+ New Card

- Alot of bug fixes (again...)

#### Detail on new ID system
New ID system use the card name and stat instead of where the card get define in the code. The new system use the card name first and last letter then the length of the card name (counting the spaces) then it power and health. So for example if the card was "Adder" with 1 power and 1 health. Then it ID will be "Ar511".
